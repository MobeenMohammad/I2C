# Design of I2C Protocol & EEPROM Verification (Verilog)
This project implements the Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) protocol and verifies an EEPROM memory model using Verilog HDL.
It demonstrates reliable serial communication between a Master and Slave (EEPROM) using two-wire communication (SCL & SDA).
# Overview
- Designed an I2C Master and I2C Slave (EEPROM) using FSM-based Verilog
- Supports Read, Write, and Erase operations
- Verified through testbench and waveform analysis
- Simulates real-time EEPROM communication over I2C

# Design of I2C Protocol & EEPROM Verification (Verilog)
This project implements the Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) protocol and verifies an EEPROM memory model using Verilog HDL.
It demonstrates reliable serial communication between a Master and Slave (EEPROM) using two-wire communication (SCL & SDA)
